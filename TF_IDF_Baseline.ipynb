forward .    although [ rem : angel ] the main goal of  @xcite was the analysis of spatial @xmath94-coalescents , they also provide some large deviations bounds on kingman s coalescent .\\nthese bounds are mainly based on markov inequality .\\nprecisely , in lemma 2.2 in @xcite it is shown that for @xmath95 @xmath96 and therefore @xmath97 in the neighbourhood of @xmath98 the last inequality translates easily into a bound for the rate function @xmath84 from ; see figure  [ fig : cor1 ] .\\nnamely , for @xmath99 we have @xmath100    next , we state some large deviations results connected to  . for @xmath101 we know from   that @xmath102 holds almost surely .\\nthe proof of this result is based on the well - known fact ( see e.g.  section  5 in @xcite ) that the distribution of @xmath103 can be derived using uniform order statistics : let @xmath104 be independent and uniformly distributed on @xmath105 $ ] , and @xmath106 be their order statistics .\\nadditionally , let @xmath107 be independent exponentially distributed random variables with mean @xmath23 . then , @xmath108 here the second equality in distribution is one of the well known representations of uniform spacings ; see e.g.  section  4.1 in @xcite .\\nit follows @xmath109 we will use this representation to obtain large deviations results for @xmath103 . in particular\\nwe show that upwards large deviations of @xmath103 are on the scale @xmath6 while downwards large deviations are on the scale @xmath1 . the proof is given in section  [ sec : proof - theorem - reft2 ] .    for [ t2 ]\\neach @xmath110 , we have @xmath111 furthermore @xmath112 and for each @xmath113 , we have @xmath114 the function @xmath115 is positive for @xmath116 and is given by @xmath117 here @xmath118 is a function of the form @xmath119 with @xmath120 where @xmath121 denotes the distribution function of the one dimensional standard gaussian distribution .\\nthough the rate function in   is exact it is hard to treat analytically . for this reason we provide in theorem  [ t3 ] a much simpler lower bound for downwards large deviations of @xmath103 . for the proof we use the following lemma which provides another representation of @xmath103 in terms of exponential random variables ( see section  [ sec : proofs2 ] for proofs ) .\\nlet [ l : wn ] @xmath122 be independent exponentially distributed random variables with mean @xmath23 .\\nthen , @xmath123    for [ t3 ] @xmath124 we have @xmath125    the main point in the proof of lemma  [ l : wn ] is that @xmath103 does not depend on the order of the @xmath126 and hence we can as well order them according to their size .\\nlet us briefly explain how we will use in the proof of in . since @xmath103 is minimal if @xmath127 ( whence @xmath128 ) , we have to look for possibilities that all @xmath126 s are of about the same size in order to obtain a large deviations result for @xmath103 .\\nlet @xmath129 denote the above exponential random variables ordered in increasing order , i.e.  @xmath130 is the @xmath4th smallest value .\\nusing `` competing exponential clocks '' arguments ( see also the proof of the lemma ) one can see that @xmath131 is exponentially distributed with mean @xmath132 . hence , one way of obtaining similar values for all @xmath126 s arises if @xmath133 is particularly large , which then leads to a large deviations result for @xmath103 .     from in theorem  [ t2 ] and the lower bound from in theorem  [ t3].,width=226 ]    \\\\1 .\\nlet us give some heuristics about the rates arising in theorem  [ t2 ] . for , we have to ask ourselves about the easiest way @xmath103\\nbecomes too large . from\\n, we see that this is the case if one of the @xmath126 s is too large , making this kind of deviations a local property in the sense that only a single of the @xmath126 s has to show some untypical behavior .\\nthis is different when looking at , i.e.  too small values of @xmath103 .\\nfirst , observe that @xmath103 is small only if all ( or many ) families have about equal sizes ( extreme case @xmath134 gives the minimal value @xmath128 ) .\\nhence , such downward deviations require to study a global property of the random variable @xmath103 , which is significantly harder .\\nfor the proof of we will interpret @xmath103 as a self - normalised sum and use from @xcite a result on large deviations result for such sums .    \\\\2 . from\\n, we see that in fact @xmath103 is a function of uniform order statistics , which , for instance , have been studied in detail ( although no large deviations results were given ) in @xcite .\\nhence , theorem  [ t2 ] may as well be interpreted as a large deviations result for uniform order statistics .    \\\\3 .\\nas stated in remark  [ rem : interllnfe ] , @xmath135 can be interpreted as homozygosity at time @xmath0 . using a poisson process along the tree with intensity @xmath136 , we can ask for the probability of picking two leaves from the tree which are not separated by a poisson mark , denoted by _ homozygosity in state _ , abbreviated by @xmath137 . this quantity is closely related to the poisson - dirichlet distribution and some large deviations ( in the limit of large @xmath138 )\\nwere derived in @xcite .\\nit is shown there in theorem  5.1 that @xmath139 and that @xmath140 for @xmath141 . however , a large deviation principle for the quantity @xmath142 ( noting that @xmath143 ) , which corresponds to the results from theorem  [ t2 ] , could not be obtained by @xcite . at least , it was shown that its scale can not be larger than @xmath144 .\\nthe proof of theorem  [ t1 ] is an application of the grtner -

, the parameters @xmath3 and @xmath2 have spin 0 and the parameters @xmath70 have spin @xmath71  @xcite . to analyze the sgwb on the sky , it is convenient to expand the stokes parameters by spherical harmonics @xmath72\\n. however , since @xmath70 parameters have spin @xmath71 , they have to be expanded by the spin -

to - noise ratio . in the case of interferometer\\n, the optimal filter function falls to zero for large @xmath116 compered to the travel time of the light between the detecters .\\nsince the signals of two detectors are expected to correlate due to the same effect of the gravitational waves , the optimal filter function should behave this way .\\nthen , typically one of the detectors is very close to the other compared to the total observation time @xmath1 .\\ntherefore , the total observation time @xmath1 can be extended to @xmath117 @xcite .\\nin contrast , in the case of pta , it is invalid that @xmath1 is very large compered to the travel time of the light between the pulsars .\\nnevertheless , we can assume that one of the two @xmath1 can be expanded to @xmath117 , because in situations @xmath118 and @xmath119 it is known that we can ignore the effect of the distance @xmath120 of pulsars .\\nin this case , it is clear that any locations of the pulsars are optimal and optimal filter function should behave like as the interferometer case @xcite .    using these assumptions @xmath118 and @xmath119 , we can rewrite as @xmath121 where @xmath122 note that @xmath123 satisfies @xmath124 , because @xmath125 is real .\\nmoreover , to deal with the unphysical region @xmath126 we require @xmath127 .\\nthus , @xmath123 becomes real .\\ntaking the ensemble average , using @xmath128 , @xmath118 , and assuming the noises in the two measurements are not correlated , we get @xmath129\\\\ , \\\\label{s2}\\\\end{aligned}\\\\ ] ] where we have defined @xmath130 the functions @xmath131 and @xmath132 are called the generalized orfs , which describe the angular sensitivity of the pulsars for the sgwb . note that , as we already mentioned , we consider the cases of @xmath41 for simplicity\\n. then we have assumed @xmath118 and @xmath119 , this assumption implies that approximately becomes @xmath133 due to the rapid oscillation of the phase factor .\\ntherefore , the distance @xmath120 of the pulsars does not appear in the generalized orfs , and hence the generalized orfs do not depend on the frequency .    as you can see from ,\\nthe correlation of the two measurements involve both the total intensity and the circular polarization .\\nhowever , the degeneracy can be disentangled by using separation method , which will be discussed in the section [ sec : separation method ] .\\nin this section , we consider the generalized orfs for circular polarizations : @xmath134 where we defined @xmath135 in the above , we have used and the fact that the generalized orfs do not depend on frequency . for computation of the generalized orfs for circular polarizations ,\\nit is convenient to use the computational frame @xcite defined by @xmath136 where @xmath137 is the angular separation between the two pulsars . using -

gravitational waves ( g.w . ) is to perform all sky surveys , based on `` blind searches '' , where the source parameters are unknown . in this case\\nhierarchical procedures are applied , based on a sequence of increasing resolution steps . in this paper\\nwe study in details the problem of sensitivity loss due to discretization of parameters and to the needs to limit the computing cost , with hough procedures .\\nin particular , we propose and study the characteristics of a frequency hough procedure , designed mainly to reduce the discretization problem , and we compare it with the sky hough procedure , which is actually used in the virgo collaboration .\\n+ the paper is organized as follows : in sect .\\n2 we present the basic scheme of the rome hierarchical procedure , based on the main idea of coincidences among subsets of data ; in sect .\\n3 we discuss the limits due to digitization of the sky hough procedure ; in sects . 4 , 5 we present the new frequency hough procedure , discussing details its implementation and its basic characteristics ; in sect .\\n6 we present the study of amplitude losses due to digitization , and thus efficiencies , for both the procedures .\\nconclusions and comments are given in sect .\\nhierarchical procedures , based on hough transform algorithms , are applied by various groups in the g.w . community .\\nsee , for example , references @xcite .\\nthere are various ways of implementing the hierarchical procedure and the hough transform .\\nthe hough transform is a linear transform that is used to recognize the parameters of the analytical description of a curve from the position of some points on it .\\nit operates on an `` image '' of points , in our case the peakmap in the time - frequency plane . for each peak of this map\\nwe increase a set of bins of a multi - dimensional histogram ( in our case a two - dimensional histogram ) defined on the parameters space , called the hough map . in the old procedure ,\\nthe parameter space was the position of the source , i.e. the celestial sphere , and we fixed the spin down value for each hough map . in the new one ,\\nthe parameter space is the plane @xmath0 , and for each hough map , we fix the position of the source . the mapping ( i.e. which points of the hough map must be increased for a certain point in the peakmap ) can be done in different ways : we use always what we call the `` biunivocal mapping '' , i.e. a mapping in which every point in the hough map derive from a single point of the peakmap at a given time .\\nit is easy to demonstrate that in this case the mapping is also uniform , i.e. in the case of uniformly distributed random dots in the peakmap , the expected value of the hough map @xmath1 is a constant ( for all parameter value ) .\\nthis value , depending on the number n of the spectra of the peakmap and on the mapping , defines the `` noise '' of the map .\\nit is binomially distributed with parameters n and @xmath2 .\\nwe will refer here to the rome scheme , presently used in virgo data .\\n[ fig : schema ] shows the basic scheme of the rome hierarchical procedure .\\ndetails on the main aspects of the procedure are given in references @xcite .\\nafter data cleaning ( short time domain disturbances removal ) and `` short ffts data base '' ( sfdb ) creation , peakmaps are computed , using a very refined auto - regressive algorithm to equalize the spectral data by an appropriate follow - up of the noise .\\npeakmaps are frequency vs time maps , obtained from equalized spectra by selecting all the local maxima above a chosen threshold .\\nan accurate cleaning of peakmaps , by removing known noise lines and the more persistent lines , is needed and its implementation is critical for the next step analysis . on the cleaned peakmaps ,\\nmethods of peaks detection are applied .\\nthat is , transformation from the input plane to the hough plane , thresholding and first order candidates selection .\\ncandidate parameters are defined by source frequency , celestial coordinates , first spin - down parameter .\\nthe need for coincidences among candidates obtained in different subsets of data ( two in the scheme of fig .\\n[ fig : schema ] ) has been discussed in references @xcite .\\nthis method is very efficient to reduce the number of spurious candidates at a fixed threshold .\\nthus , for a given false alarm probability , we can lower the threshold -with respect to the choice of not doing coincidences- gaining in detection efficiency .\\nthe method has a better efficiency when the data sets have similar sensitivities .\\nafter the coincidence , the survived candidates are analyzed coherently with longer ffts on corrected data .\\nthen the spectral filtering is used to take into account the spread of the power in five bands , as explained in reference @xcite .\\nfinally , second order candidates are produced .\\nas stated before , the sky hough method shows amplitude losses , and thus loss of sensitivity , which are due to digitization of parameters .\\nthis effect shows up mainly for the complexity of the transform together with the need of reducing the computing cost :    * the method is based on a transform between the time - frequency peakmap and the celestial sphere .\\nit is not simple for the non linearity of the mapping ; * to reduce the computational effort , we need to use `` look - up tables '' which introduce further digitization errors ; * to reduce the computational effort , fast algorithms have been developed , which require the use of a rectangular grid to map the sky . compared to the `` optimal '' ( see later ) grid , the rectangular one has over - resolution in some regions of the sky .\\nthis leads also to a higher number of candidates .\\n* the use of the celestial map as the space to spot the candidates is very prone to artifacts , see @xcite : some regions are always `` privileged '' , that is they have a higher candidates number with respect to the expectation . the problem arises because each hough map is constructed over the whole sky .    hence , it seemed important the study of alternative procedures .\\ngiven the observation that most of the problems are related to the complexity of the transformation , we exploit the possibility of the use of a different but simpler transformation . a part the simplicity of the transformation we obviously need to study a procedure which is less , or equivalently , computationally expensive .\\ntherefore we studied a procedure which has a better , or equivalent , sensitivity , at the same computational cost of the sky hough .\\nthe transformation we propose transforms the * time - observed frequency * plane into the * source frequency - spin down * plane . let\\ns go into details . if @xmath3 is the frequency ( doppler corrected for a given sky direction ) , @xmath4 the source intrinsic frequency , @xmath5 the first spin - down parameter , @xmath6 the time at the detector and @xmath7 a reference time , we have that @xmath8 a straight line in the hough plane .\\nwe then get the following : @xmath9 each point in the input plane @xmath10 , that is a peak in the doppler shifted peakmap , is transformed into a straight line in the hough @xmath11 plane , with slope @xmath12 .\\nthe slope depends on the choice of the reference time .\\nif we choose @xmath7 equal to the beginning time of the data we analyze , then the slope is always negative and inversely proportional to the time gap .\\n+ this is the choice we have done here . in addition , considering the width @xmath13 of the frequency bins in the input plane we notice that each peak is transformed into a stripe among two parallel straight lines    @xmath14    it is a linear transformation .\\nnow the input plane is obtained from the original peakmap by correcting it for the doppler shift due to the earth revolution and rotation , for each point in the sky grid we need to analyze .\\nthus `` time '' is the time at the detector and `` frequency '' the observed frequency , after the doppler correction .\\nbut , as each sfdb is short enough to not be affected by a time - varying doppler shift , then the doppler effect removal from the original peakmap , obtained from the collection of all the sfdb data , reduces to a very simple `` shifting '' procedure of the peakmap bins . in the analysis scheme , this bins shift is part of the hough procedure . + in the following , we give details on the construction of the map .\\nthe frequency hough map is constructed using the `` direct differential method '' , as is done with the sky hough . with this method , instead of building directly the hough map , one builds a map that , if `` integrated '' ( i.e. summed over bins from left to right ) , gives the hough map .\\nthis is important to minimize the number of floating point operations .\\nas already explained , for each sky position , the input peakmap is got from the original one by shifting bins to correct for the doppler effect .\\nthe sky is sampled with a non uniform covering grid , which will be later discussed . here\\nwe explain in detail the technique , by giving the sequence of operations :    * for each point in the sky grid , for each coordinate in the input plane @xmath10 and for each spin - down value @xmath15 ,    the map is incremented by 1 in the point @xmath16 and decremented by 1 in the point @xmath17 .    hence ,\\nfor each sky position , a differential map is constructed .\\nthe sum of the bins along the frequency direction is then performed to construct the final integral map .\\nthis two dimensional histogram is the frequency hough map . in the algorithm implementation\\nwe plan to divide the input peakmap into 10 hz bands , thus constructing , for each position in the sky , a different hough map every 10 hz .\\n+ in case there is the need to exploit higher order one spin down parameters , one ( or more ) loop(s ) has ( have ) to be added to the sequence of operations , to scan the discrete set of values of the new parameter(s ) .\\nthis clearly influences the computing cost , but does not change the basics of the method .\\nlet s first discuss two peculiar aspects of this new method , which are the basis of its appeal .      from the given analysis scheme , it is easy to see that the frequency resolution for the estimation of the source frequency @xmath4 can be enhanced , with respect to the binning frequency @xmath13 , without relevantly affecting the computational effort .\\nin fact , the use of a resolution @xmath18 with @xmath19 , affects only the size of the hough map .\\nthis has a computational cost only when summing over the bins to construct the integral map from the differential one .\\nbut we notice that the total cost of the construction of the hough map is due to the construction of the differential map , dominated by the number of peaks in the peakmap and to the construction of the integral map , dominated by the number of bins .\\nthe former , in all practical cases , is the one which dominates .\\n+ the possibility to enhance the frequency resolution results to be , as will be shown in the next sections , a very important peculiarity of the new method .\\nit which enhances considerably the efficiency , by reducing the digitalization effect .\\nthe same in the sky hough procedure would have a relevant computational cost .\\nregarding the increasing of the spin down resolution , it would cost for both the procedures : the better the resolution in the spin down estimation the higher is the number of loops of the procedures .      here\\nwe describe how we construct the grid on the sky .\\nsuppose two sources , at the same frequency @xmath4 and same latitude @xmath20 .\\ntheir angular delay @xmath21 with respect to the detector rotation produces a time delay @xmath22 .\\nthe two sources will then have the same frequency variation at the detector , which is the classical equation due to the doppler effect , @xmath23 but with time delay @xmath24 .\\nthe observed frequency difference has thus a maximum value which is given by @xmath25 thus the angular resolution is , in radians : @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the number of points in the doppler band for a signal of max frequency @xmath4 : @xmath28 and @xmath29 .\\n+ we now repeat the same reasoning , supposing the two sources , at the same frequency @xmath4 and same longitude @xmath30 .\\nthe two sources will have the same frequency variation at the detector , now given by @xmath31 , but with an angular delay @xmath32 .\\nthe observed frequency difference has a maximum value which is : @xmath33 we obtain for the angular resolution , in radians : @xmath34 using eqs .\\n[ gammalong ] and [ gammalat ] we get : @xmath35 @xmath36 using these equations we construct the grid on the sky , which we call the `` optimal '' grid .\\nthe points of the grid are not uniformly distributed . with a simulation\\n, we have estimated the the number of points in the grid @xmath37 , which is , in the high frequency limit : @xmath38 @xmath39 is an extra resolution factor , which can be greater than 1 , to enhance the efficiency , but even less than 1 , to save computing cost , obviously worsening the efficiency .\\nfig.[fig : gridsim1 ] shows the optimal sky grid , for @xmath40 ( which corresponds to a source frequency @xmath41 hz ) .\\nas already said , the grid used in the sky hough method , is not optimal , but rectangular , to use fastest computing algorithms .\\nthe number of points in this rectangular grid is : @xmath42 which is , asymptotically , a factor @xmath43 higher then the number of points of the optimal grid . in fact\\nthis grid has to be over resolved to maintain the same sensitivity of the corresponding optimal grid .\\nfurther , we note that this over resolution produces a higher number of candidates from certain sky positions .    ,\\nx - axis : ecliptical longitude , degrees , from 0 to 400 ; y - axis : ecliptical latitude , degrees , from -100 to 100 ; the number of points in the map is @xmath37=2902.,width=453 ]          the sensitivity of the sky hough procedure is affected by artifacts , i.e. an excess of candidates in some places of the sky map , which are due to local spectral disturbances . the effect ca nt be eliminated because each map is constructed over the whole sky , and hence the threshold for candidate selection has to be the same for the whole sky . using the frequency hough procedure\\nthis effect disappears because each map is constructed for only one position in the sky .\\nso , because of the adaptivity of the threshold , if a sky region gives an excess of candidates , the threshold is raised and then there is a loss in sensitivity only for that sky region .\\nwe are now ready to enter into details by studying the efficiency of both the methods , by the use of simulations .\\nfigure [ fig : gridsim2 ] is an example of how a frequency hough map looks like , having injected into white noise three signals , at different frequencies and spin - down .      to study the efficiency of the methods , as a function of the frequency over resolution factor\\n, we have simulated a signal in the absence of noise .\\nthe reason for this is that we were interested in studying only the losses due to the discretization errors .\\nthe parameters chosen for the simulation are similar to actual situations ( detector parameters , source expected parameters ) .\\nthe parameters of the simulation are shown in table [ tab : par ] .\\n[ fig : freqloss ] shows the amplitude loss versus the frequency over resolution factor @xmath45 .\\nthe loss was calculated as the average value of all the peaks found in the 500 spectra ( it is important to remember that our procedure considers peaks only the maxima above threshold ) .\\nthe result is clear : using @xmath46 the amplitude loss is 3.6 @xmath47 ( the efficiency @xmath48 ) , while with @xmath49 , which is the only practically possible choice of the sky hough , the amplitude loss is 11.6 @xmath47 ( the efficiency @xmath50 ) . from the figure ,\\nwe notice that there is no further gain of increasing the over resolution factor over 10 .\\nthus , we fixed to 10 the over resolution factor for the frequency hough .\\nin next simulations , results with @xmath46 are thus for the frequency hough , results with @xmath49 are for the sky hough .\\nonce we have fixed the frequency over resolution factor we wanted to quantify how the increasing of the spin down resolution from the nominal one would affect the sensitivity .\\nthe results are in fig .\\n[ fig : freqloss1 ] , which shows the loss in amplitude vs the spin down over resolution factor , for both the cases @xmath49 , sky hough , and @xmath46,frequency hough .\\nit can be noticed that , in the case of the frequency hough , even for the worst analyzed situation , which corresponds to the nominal spin down step @xmath51 the loss is quite small .\\nis is 3.6 @xmath47 ( the efficiency @xmath48 ) .\\nthe situation is worst for the sky hough , where the loss in amplitude at the nominal spin down step is 11.6 @xmath47 ( the efficiency @xmath50 ) .\\nthe improvement obtained by a better spin down resolution is not so important , as can be seen from the figure .\\nit seems reasonable , given the observation that increasing the spin down resolution has a computational cost for both the methods , to use the nominal @xmath52 resolution ( x - axis equal to 1 in the figure ) .      to study the loss due to the sky grid resolution\\n, we have simulated 50 signals , randomly distributed over the sky .\\nwe have then looked for results using the optimal grid , again registering the average value of all the detected peaks . in what follows ,\\nwe suppose to use the optimal grid for both the procedures , sky and frequency hough .\\nfig.[fig : loss_spinres ] shows the amplitude losses , as a function of the over resolution sky map factor @xmath39 , in the two cases of @xmath46 ( left ) , frequency hough , and @xmath49 ( right ) , sky hough .\\nthe amplitude loss , for @xmath44 , is @xmath53 for the frequency hough , and @xmath54 , for the sky hough .\\nagain , a better efficiency for the new procedure .\\nwe notice that the use of an over resolution for the sky map , would have an impact on the computing cost , with both the procedures .    .\\nthe figures compare the loss when @xmath46 ( left ) , frequency hough , and when @xmath55 ( right ) , sky hough.,title=\\\"fig:\\\",width=302 ] .\\nthe figures compare the loss when @xmath46 ( left ) , frequency hough , and when @xmath55 ( right ) , sky hough.,title=\\\"fig:\\\",width=302 ]        + we see that the ratio of the amplitude efficiencies is @xmath57 which in power is 1.317 . from this\\n, we can compute the gain in computing cost for the same sensitivity .\\nlet us firstly recall that the @xmath58 sensitivity in the hierarchical search is proportional to @xmath59 , and the computing cost to @xmath60 .\\nthus , the `` equivalent fft '' length factor is @xmath61=1.734 and the gain in computing cost is @xmath62=5.2 ( that is , the ratio of computing costs needed to have the same @xmath58 sensitivity ) .      * the * adaptivity * , that is the weight of peaks to consider the noise level and the gain due to the antenna pattern toward a direction , is , with this approach , immediate and very simple , as each hough map is done for a single sky position .\\nit has been shown , with the sky hough , that the adaptivity of the procedure is a very important task for the analysis ; * this new procedure is appropriate also for all those situations in which the * source position * is known and we should estimate only source frequency and spin down ; * with a proper choice of parameters , it is also possible to detect and hence remove * spurious signals * , with a constant or linearly varying frequency .    on the latter point , we are now working to study the efficiency of this method in terms of rejection of spurious lines in the peakmap . we know that this is a very critical task for the analysis , since the presence of spurious lines highly affects the sensitivity of the search .\\nwe expect this new method to be much more insensitive to the presence of spurious lines , since in the chosen hough plane spurious lines and g.w .\\nsignals should have a very different and well separable behavior .\\nb. krisnan , a. sintes , m. a. papa , b .\\nf. schutz , s.

normalised sum and use from @xcite a result on large deviations result for such sums .    \\\\2 . from\\n, we see that in fact @xmath103 is a function of uniform order statistics , which , for instance , have been studied in detail ( although no large deviations results were given ) in @xcite .\\nhence , theorem  [ t2 ] may as well be interpreted as a large deviations result for uniform order statistics .    \\\\3 .\\nas stated in remark  [ rem : interllnfe ] , @xmath135 can be interpreted as homozygosity at time @xmath0 . using a poisson process along the tree with intensity @xmath136 , we can ask for the probability of picking two leaves from the tree which are not separated by a poisson mark , denoted by _ homozygosity in state _ , abbreviated by @xmath137 . this quantity is closely related to the poisson -

gravitational waves ( g.w . ) is to perform all sky surveys , based on `` blind searches '' , where the source parameters are unknown . in this case\\nhierarchical procedures are applied , based on a sequence of increasing resolution steps . in this paper\\nwe study in details the problem of sensitivity loss due to discretization of parameters and to the needs to limit the computing cost , with hough procedures .\\nin particular , we propose and study the characteristics of a frequency hough procedure , designed mainly to reduce the discretization problem , and we compare it with the sky hough procedure , which is actually used in the virgo collaboration .\\n+ the paper is organized as follows : in sect .\\n2 we present the basic scheme of the rome hierarchical procedure , based on the main idea of coincidences among subsets of data ; in sect .\\n3 we discuss the limits due to digitization of the sky hough procedure ; in sects . 4 , 5 we present the new frequency hough procedure , discussing details its implementation and its basic characteristics ; in sect .\\n6 we present the study of amplitude losses due to digitization , and thus efficiencies , for both the procedures .\\nconclusions and comments are given in sect .\\nhierarchical procedures , based on hough transform algorithms , are applied by various groups in the g.w . community .\\nsee , for example , references @xcite .\\nthere are various ways of implementing the hierarchical procedure and the hough transform .\\nthe hough transform is a linear transform that is used to recognize the parameters of the analytical description of a curve from the position of some points on it .\\nit operates on an `` image '' of points , in our case the peakmap in the time - frequency plane . for each peak of this map\\nwe increase a set of bins of a multi - dimensional histogram ( in our case a two - dimensional histogram ) defined on the parameters space , called the hough map . in the old procedure ,\\nthe parameter space was the position of the source , i.e. the celestial sphere , and we fixed the spin down value for each hough map . in the new one ,\\nthe parameter space is the plane @xmath0 , and for each hough map , we fix the position of the source . the mapping ( i.e. which points of the hough map must be increased for a certain point in the peakmap ) can be done in different ways : we use always what we call the `` biunivocal mapping '' , i.e. a mapping in which every point in the hough map derive from a single point of the peakmap at a given time .\\nit is easy to demonstrate that in this case the mapping is also uniform , i.e. in the case of uniformly distributed random dots in the peakmap , the expected value of the hough map @xmath1 is a constant ( for all parameter value ) .\\nthis value , depending on the number n of the spectra of the peakmap and on the mapping , defines the `` noise '' of the map .\\nit is binomially distributed with parameters n and @xmath2 .\\nwe will refer here to the rome scheme , presently used in virgo data .\\n[ fig : schema ] shows the basic scheme of the rome hierarchical procedure .\\ndetails on the main aspects of the procedure are given in references @xcite .\\nafter data cleaning ( short time domain disturbances removal ) and `` short ffts data base '' ( sfdb ) creation , peakmaps are computed , using a very refined auto - regressive algorithm to equalize the spectral data by an appropriate follow - up of the noise .\\npeakmaps are frequency vs time maps , obtained from equalized spectra by selecting all the local maxima above a chosen threshold .\\nan accurate cleaning of peakmaps , by removing known noise lines and the more persistent lines , is needed and its implementation is critical for the next step analysis . on the cleaned peakmaps ,\\nmethods of peaks detection are applied .\\nthat is , transformation from the input plane to the hough plane , thresholding and first order candidates selection .\\ncandidate parameters are defined by source frequency , celestial coordinates , first spin - down parameter .\\nthe need for coincidences among candidates obtained in different subsets of data ( two in the scheme of fig .\\n[ fig : schema ] ) has been discussed in references @xcite .\\nthis method is very efficient to reduce the number of spurious candidates at a fixed threshold .\\nthus , for a given false alarm probability , we can lower the threshold -with respect to the choice of not doing coincidences- gaining in detection efficiency .\\nthe method has a better efficiency when the data sets have similar sensitivities .\\nafter the coincidence , the survived candidates are analyzed coherently with longer ffts on corrected data .\\nthen the spectral filtering is used to take into account the spread of the power in five bands , as explained in reference @xcite .\\nfinally , second order candidates are produced .\\nas stated before , the sky hough method shows amplitude losses , and thus loss of sensitivity , which are due to digitization of parameters .\\nthis effect shows up mainly for the complexity of the transform together with the need of reducing the computing cost :    * the method is based on a transform between the time - frequency peakmap and the celestial sphere .\\nit is not simple for the non linearity of the mapping ; * to reduce the computational effort , we need to use `` look - up tables '' which introduce further digitization errors ; * to reduce the computational effort , fast algorithms have been developed , which require the use of a rectangular grid to map the sky . compared to the `` optimal '' ( see later ) grid , the rectangular one has over - resolution in some regions of the sky .\\nthis leads also to a higher number of candidates .\\n* the use of the celestial map as the space to spot the candidates is very prone to artifacts , see @xcite : some regions are always `` privileged '' , that is they have a higher candidates number with respect to the expectation . the problem arises because each hough map is constructed over the whole sky .    hence , it seemed important the study of alternative procedures .\\ngiven the observation that most of the problems are related to the complexity of the transformation , we exploit the possibility of the use of a different but simpler transformation . a part the simplicity of the transformation we obviously need to study a procedure which is less , or equivalently , computationally expensive .\\ntherefore we studied a procedure which has a better , or equivalent , sensitivity , at the same computational cost of the sky hough .\\nthe transformation we propose transforms the * time - observed frequency * plane into the * source frequency - spin down * plane . let\\ns go into details . if @xmath3 is the frequency ( doppler corrected for a given sky direction ) , @xmath4 the source intrinsic frequency , @xmath5 the first spin - down parameter , @xmath6 the time at the detector and @xmath7 a reference time , we have that @xmath8 a straight line in the hough plane .\\nwe then get the following : @xmath9 each point in the input plane @xmath10 , that is a peak in the doppler shifted peakmap , is transformed into a straight line in the hough @xmath11 plane , with slope @xmath12 .\\nthe slope depends on the choice of the reference time .\\nif we choose @xmath7 equal to the beginning time of the data we analyze , then the slope is always negative and inversely proportional to the time gap .\\n+ this is the choice we have done here . in addition , considering the width @xmath13 of the frequency bins in the input plane we notice that each peak is transformed into a stripe among two parallel straight lines    @xmath14    it is a linear transformation .\\nnow the input plane is obtained from the original peakmap by correcting it for the doppler shift due to the earth revolution and rotation , for each point in the sky grid we need to analyze .\\nthus `` time '' is the time at the detector and `` frequency '' the observed frequency , after the doppler correction .\\nbut , as each sfdb is short enough to not be affected by a time - varying doppler shift , then the doppler effect removal from the original peakmap , obtained from the collection of all the sfdb data , reduces to a very simple `` shifting '' procedure of the peakmap bins . in the analysis scheme , this bins shift is part of the hough procedure . + in the following , we give details on the construction of the map .\\nthe frequency hough map is constructed using the `` direct differential method '' , as is done with the sky hough . with this method , instead of building directly the hough map , one builds a map that , if `` integrated '' ( i.e. summed over bins from left to right ) , gives the hough map .\\nthis is important to minimize the number of floating point operations .\\nas already explained , for each sky position , the input peakmap is got from the original one by shifting bins to correct for the doppler effect .\\nthe sky is sampled with a non uniform covering grid , which will be later discussed . here\\nwe explain in detail the technique , by giving the sequence of operations :    * for each point in the sky grid , for each coordinate in the input plane @xmath10 and for each spin - down value @xmath15 ,    the map is incremented by 1 in the point @xmath16 and decremented by 1 in the point @xmath17 .    hence ,\\nfor each sky position , a differential map is constructed .\\nthe sum of the bins along the frequency direction is then performed to construct the final integral map .\\nthis two dimensional histogram is the frequency hough map . in the algorithm implementation\\nwe plan to divide the input peakmap into 10 hz bands , thus constructing , for each position in the sky , a different hough map every 10 hz .\\n+ in case there is the need to exploit higher order one spin down parameters , one ( or more ) loop(s ) has ( have ) to be added to the sequence of operations , to scan the discrete set of values of the new parameter(s ) .\\nthis clearly influences the computing cost , but does not change the basics of the method .\\nlet s first discuss two peculiar aspects of this new method , which are the basis of its appeal .      from the given analysis scheme , it is easy to see that the frequency resolution for the estimation of the source frequency @xmath4 can be enhanced , with respect to the binning frequency @xmath13 , without relevantly affecting the computational effort .\\nin fact , the use of a resolution @xmath18 with @xmath19 , affects only the size of the hough map .\\nthis has a computational cost only when summing over the bins to construct the integral map from the differential one .\\nbut we notice that the total cost of the construction of the hough map is due to the construction of the differential map , dominated by the number of peaks in the peakmap and to the construction of the integral map , dominated by the number of bins .\\nthe former , in all practical cases , is the one which dominates .\\n+ the possibility to enhance the frequency resolution results to be , as will be shown in the next sections , a very important peculiarity of the new method .\\nit which enhances considerably the efficiency , by reducing the digitalization effect .\\nthe same in the sky hough procedure would have a relevant computational cost .\\nregarding the increasing of the spin down resolution , it would cost for both the procedures : the better the resolution in the spin down estimation the higher is the number of loops of the procedures .      here\\nwe describe how we construct the grid on the sky .\\nsuppose two sources , at the same frequency @xmath4 and same latitude @xmath20 .\\ntheir angular delay @xmath21 with respect to the detector rotation produces a time delay @xmath22 .\\nthe two sources will then have the same frequency variation at the detector , which is the classical equation due to the doppler effect , @xmath23 but with time delay @xmath24 .\\nthe observed frequency difference has thus a maximum value which is given by @xmath25 thus the angular resolution is , in radians : @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the number of points in the doppler band for a signal of max frequency @xmath4 : @xmath28 and @xmath29 .\\n+ we now repeat the same reasoning , supposing the two sources , at the same frequency @xmath4 and same longitude @xmath30 .\\nthe two sources will have the same frequency variation at the detector , now given by @xmath31 , but with an angular delay @xmath32 .\\nthe observed frequency difference has a maximum value which is : @xmath33 we obtain for the angular resolution , in radians : @xmath34 using eqs .\\n[ gammalong ] and [ gammalat ] we get : @xmath35 @xmath36 using these equations we construct the grid on the sky , which we call the `` optimal '' grid .\\nthe points of the grid are not uniformly distributed . with a simulation\\n, we have estimated the the number of points in the grid @xmath37 , which is , in the high frequency limit : @xmath38 @xmath39 is an extra resolution factor , which can be greater than 1 , to enhance the efficiency , but even less than 1 , to save computing cost , obviously worsening the efficiency .\\nfig.[fig : gridsim1 ] shows the optimal sky grid , for @xmath40 ( which corresponds to a source frequency @xmath41 hz ) .\\nas already said , the grid used in the sky hough method , is not optimal , but rectangular , to use fastest computing algorithms .\\nthe number of points in this rectangular grid is : @xmath42 which is , asymptotically , a factor @xmath43 higher then the number of points of the optimal grid . in fact\\nthis grid has to be over resolved to maintain the same sensitivity of the corresponding optimal grid .\\nfurther , we note that this over resolution produces a higher number of candidates from certain sky positions .    ,\\nx - axis : ecliptical longitude , degrees , from 0 to 400 ; y - axis : ecliptical latitude , degrees , from -100 to 100 ; the number of points in the map is @xmath37=2902.,width=453 ]          the sensitivity of the sky hough procedure is affected by artifacts , i.e. an excess of candidates in some places of the sky map , which are due to local spectral disturbances . the effect ca nt be eliminated because each map is constructed over the whole sky , and hence the threshold for candidate selection has to be the same for the whole sky . using the frequency hough procedure\\nthis effect disappears because each map is constructed for only one position in the sky .\\nso , because of the adaptivity of the threshold , if a sky region gives an excess of candidates , the threshold is raised and then there is a loss in sensitivity only for that sky region .\\nwe are now ready to enter into details by studying the efficiency of both the methods , by the use of simulations .\\nfigure [ fig : gridsim2 ] is an example of how a frequency hough map looks like , having injected into white noise three signals , at different frequencies and spin - down .      to study the efficiency of the methods , as a function of the frequency over resolution factor\\n, we have simulated a signal in the absence of noise .\\nthe reason for this is that we were interested in studying only the losses due to the discretization errors .\\nthe parameters chosen for the simulation are similar to actual situations ( detector parameters , source expected parameters ) .\\nthe parameters of the simulation are shown in table [ tab : par ] .\\n[ fig : freqloss ] shows the amplitude loss versus the frequency over resolution factor @xmath45 .\\nthe loss was calculated as the average value of all the peaks found in the 500 spectra ( it is important to remember that our procedure considers peaks only the maxima above threshold ) .\\nthe result is clear : using @xmath46 the amplitude loss is 3.6 @xmath47 ( the efficiency @xmath48 ) , while with @xmath49 , which is the only practically possible choice of the sky hough , the amplitude loss is 11.6 @xmath47 ( the efficiency @xmath50 ) . from the figure ,\\nwe notice that there is no further gain of increasing the over resolution factor over 10 .\\nthus , we fixed to 10 the over resolution factor for the frequency hough .\\nin next simulations , results with @xmath46 are thus for the frequency hough , results with @xmath49 are for the sky hough .\\nonce we have fixed the frequency over resolution factor we wanted to quantify how the increasing of the spin down resolution from the nominal one would affect the sensitivity .\\nthe results are in fig .\\n[ fig : freqloss1 ] , which shows the loss in amplitude vs the spin down over resolution factor , for both the cases @xmath49 , sky hough , and @xmath46,frequency hough .\\nit can be noticed that , in the case of the frequency hough , even for the worst analyzed situation , which corresponds to

given the observation that increasing the spin down resolution has a computational cost for both the methods , to use the nominal @xmath52 resolution ( x - axis equal to 1 in the figure ) .      to study the loss due to the sky grid resolution\\n, we have simulated 50 signals , randomly distributed over the sky .\\nwe have then looked for results using the optimal grid , again registering the

see that the ratio of the amplitude efficiencies is @xmath57 which in power is 1.317 . from this\\n, we can compute the gain in computing cost for the same sensitivity .\\nlet us firstly recall that the @xmath58 sensitivity in the hierarchical search is proportional to @xmath59 , and the computing cost to @xmath60 .\\nthus , the `` equivalent fft '' length factor is @xmath61=1.734 and the gain in computing cost is @xmath62=5.2 ( that is , the ratio of computing costs needed to have the same @xmath58 sensitivity ) .      * the * adaptivity * , that is the weight of peaks to consider the noise level and the gain due to the antenna pattern toward a direction , is , with this approach , immediate and very simple , as each hough map is done for a single sky position .\\nit has been shown , with the sky hough , that the adaptivity of the procedure is a very important task for the analysis ; * this new procedure is appropriate also for all those situations in which the * source position * is known and we should estimate only source frequency and spin down ; * with a proper choice of parameters , it is also possible to detect and hence remove * spurious signals * , with a constant or linearly varying frequency .    on the latter point , we are now working to study the efficiency of this method in terms of rejection of spurious lines in the peakmap . we know that this is a very critical task for the analysis , since the presence of spurious lines highly affects the sensitivity of the search .\\nwe expect this new method to be much more insensitive to the presence of spurious lines , since in the chosen hough plane spurious lines and g.w .\\nsignals should have a very different and well separable behavior .\\nb. krisnan , a. sintes , m. a. papa , b .\\nf. schutz , s.

with a psychiatric disorder prior to their death [1]. Suicide is particularly worrisome in Bipolar Disorder (BD), given the high prevalence of this disorder and the strong association between suicide and depressive symptoms [2]. In addition, a large cohort study found that among men, the absolute risk of suicide was higher in BD (7.8%) compared to any other psychiatric condition. Among women, BD was associated with the second highest risk, at 4.8%, just below schizophrenia at 4.9% [3]. Furthermore, patients with BD showed twice the rate of suicide risk than patients with Major Depressive Disorder and about 20 to 30 times greater risk than in the general population [4].It is known that at least 90% of suicide cases occur in people with a psychiatric disorder, with mood disorders being the most prevalent condition in this scenario [1]. In addition, many of the individuals are untreated or inadequately treated [5]. Suicide prediction tools may aid health professionals to identify subjects at-risk for suicidal behavior, thus enabling not only early intervention and personalized care, but also the development of new strategies for suicide prevention. As there are already interventions available that show anti-suicidal effects, such as lithium for mood disorders [6] and clozapine for schizophrenia [7], adequate detection and treatment of these conditions may help reduce suicide rates.Virginia Woolf was a British novelist who biographers suggest suffered from BD [8]. From 1910 to 1913, Woolf was ill on several occasions [9]. During her life, she made at least three suicide attempts. She received the habitual treatments of the time, such as “rest cure therapy at home,” which consisted of gaining weight, sleeping, and “the resting of the intellect,” which also meant a recommendation not to write [10]. Virginia endured several depressive and manic episodes until she took her life [11] on March 28, 1941 during a depressive episode [10].Virginia Woolf presented several known risk factors associated with suicide in patients with BD [12] such as early traumatic experiences (sexual abuse), psychotic symptoms, family history of suicide, and a higher number of depressive episodes. Nevertheless, a meta-analysis of 365 studies showed that traditional suicide risk factors are poor predictors of a future suicide attempt [13]. A possible explanation for this finding is that complex patterns of interaction between risk factors are not considered in traditional statistics [14,15]. Moreover, the risk factors identified so far come from group-level results, and do not wield satisfactory predictive results at an individual level [13]. Thus, it is paramount to develop better models to predict suicidal behavior that include these interactions and explore different levels of information. Machine learning, a field of artificial intelligence that focuses on algorithms that can learn from data and then extract patterns to make new assumptions from unseen information, are increasingly being used in behavioral sciences to provide predictive models for clinical practice [16]. Machine learning can handle an enormous amount of data, such as text data, and combine them in nonlinear and highly interactive ways [17]. One important question is whether suicidal behavior is associated with an identifiable writing pattern. Virginia Woolf left a vast written repertoire contained in her diaries, where she wrote freely about her feelings, providing a living record of her past mood states.Machine-learning studies already published include the use of natural processing language to detect emotions present in suicide notes [18] and classify them [19], to detect suicidality in Twitter activity [20], and to extract a particular emotion in a suicide note sentence [21,22]. Similarly, it appears that electronic health records may also be of value to predict suicidal behavior [13,22]. Besides text classification, previous studies used machine-learning algorithms to predict suicide. For instance, a study reported a clinical signature by using a relevance vector machine to identify suicidality in patients with mood disorders [2]. The most relevant predictor variables in distinguishing attempters from non-attempters were previous hospitalizations for depression, lifetime history of psychosis, cocaine dependence, and post-traumatic stress disorder comorbidity [2]. Another study that used machine-learning algorithms showed that individual unrest, personal satisfaction, and reasons for living are the variables most associated with suicidality [23]. They concluded that these variables could be used to create an actionable assessment tool that may identify individual risk and protective factors [23]The present study aims to analyze whether text classification coupled with machine-learning algorithms can predict unfavorable outcomes, such as suicide, using the written records of a single individual. In order to test this hypothesis, we used the content of Virginia Woolf’s diaries and letters to assess whether there is a text signature in her writings prior to her suicide.MethodsThis is a text classification study with a machine-learning approach. We used a Naïve Bayes algorithm. It is worth mentioning that Naïve Bayes is a Bayesian method that estimates the probability of an event’s occurrence [17]. Although Naïve Bayes is not the only machine-learning method that utilizes Bayesian statistics, it is one of the most common. This is particularly true for text classification, where it has become the de facto standard [17]. For instance, this algorithm is commonly used to classify e-mails in spam or ham messages [17]. This algorithm was selected because 1) it requires relatively few examples for training, but also works well with very large numbers of examples; 2) it provides the estimated probability for a prediction; and 3) it is very effective and performs well with noisy data. Therefore, by using Naïve Bayes, we compared Virginia Woolf’s texts written over the 60 days before her death versus texts written outside this period to identify a signature associated with suicide. We included letters and diaries written by Virginia Woolf. We excluded books, novels, short stories, and article fragments.\"\n"],"metadata":{"id":"knxjbekqiYmU"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"colab":{"provenance":[],"gpuType":"T4"},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"name":"python"},"accelerator":"GPU"},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
